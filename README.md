# Digital-Signal-Design-VHDL
Personal reference for logic circuit design using VHDL language in Altera Quartus II that I had completed in 2nd year of Bachelor Degree
# Overview
This course introduce to student on how to design logic circuit using VHDL language in Altera Quartus II software and upload it in FPGA.<br>
This course included 2 session which is 2 hours theory class and 3 hours lab session per week. The student will be given task every week and big assignment on ALU design and mini-project<br>

# Mini-project
Create a game where the player need to guessing the random generated number by allowing to guess 3 times (Hangman Game). This project use Finite State Machine(FSM) model.
